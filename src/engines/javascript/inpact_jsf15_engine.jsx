Hoisting determines when it's accessible.
The Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) determines when it throws.

These rules explain:
• Why var declarations at the top are a myth (hoisting does it)
• Why let/const throw instead of returning undefined
• Why function declarations can be called before they're written
• Why closures sometimes capture the wrong value in loops

Understanding scope deeply means you write
predictable code and debug mysterious "variable is
undefined" errors in seconds instead of hours.`,
