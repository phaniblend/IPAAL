      body: `Software often deals with data that can take on one of several distinct forms or states. Without a clear way to express these possibilities, your code can become fragile, prone to errors, and difficult to understand. TypeScript's union types provide a powerful mechanism to declare that a variable or property can hold a value that belongs to one of several specified types, ensuring type safety and improving code clarity when dealing with such scenarios. This pattern is fundamental for building robust applications that handle diverse data gracefully.

This pattern appears frequently across many parts of an application. You'll encounter union types when defining the possible states of a UI component (e.g., 'loading' | 'success' | 'error'), specifying the allowed values for a configuration setting (e.g., 'light' | 'dark' theme), or describing different kinds of events that an application can process (e.g., 'click' | 'submit' | 'change'). Mastering union types allows you to write more expressive and safer code, making your applications more resilient to unexpected data and easier for other developers to maintain.`,

Your code might then try to perform actions based on these statuses, leading to runtime errors or unexpected behavior because it's expecting one of the three specific values. You'd have to write extensive runtime checks everywhere, which is tedious, error-prone, and doesn't catch issues until the code actually runs. This lack of compile-time safety means you could ship bugs that only surface when a user enters an unexpected status, making debugging a nightmare.`,

\`\`\`
- The \`type\` keyword introduces a type alias, giving a name to your union.
- String literals (e.g., \`'active'\`) are specific, exact string values.
- The \`|\` (pipe) symbol acts as an "OR", meaning the type can be *any one* of the types listed.
- This pattern provides strong type checking at compile time, catching invalid assignments early.
- Union types are not limited to string literals; they can combine any types, including primitives, objects, or other type aliases.`,
      quickRules: `**Quick rules:**
- ✅ Use union types for properties that can only take a specific, finite set of values (e.g., 'red' | 'green' | 'blue').
- ✅ Combine different primitive types (e.g., \`string | number\`) when a value could genuinely be either.
- ✅ Use union types to define distinct shapes for objects that share a common purpose but have different structures (e.g., different event types).
- ✅ Define union types at a module scope to ensure reusability and consistency.
- ❌ Do not use union types when a variable can truly be *any* string; use \`string\` instead.
- ❌ Avoid overly broad union types like \`any | string | number\` as they defeat the purpose of type safety.

When you use a union type within that blueprint, it's like saying, "For this particular part of the machine, you can either install Component A OR Component B OR Component C." The blueprint itself is fixed, but one of its internal components has a predefined set of interchangeable options, all of which are valid for that slot.

- Union types can be used as the type for any property within an \`interface\` or \`type\` alias.
- This enforces that the property's value must conform to one of the types in the union.

You can't use a tool designed only for 'active' items on the whole box, because some items might be 'inactive' or 'pending'. Type narrowing is like putting on a specialized lens that lets you clearly see *only* the 'active' items. While wearing that lens, you can safely use your 'active'-item tool, knowing that everything you're looking at is indeed 'active'. When you switch to the 'inactive' lens, you can use the 'inactive'-item tool, and so on.`,

\`\`\`tsx
type ItemStatus = 'active' | 'inactive' | 'pending';

interface Item {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  status: ItemStatus;
}

function processItem(item: Item): void {

\`\`\`
- Type narrowing is the process by which TypeScript refines the type of a variable within a specific code block.
- Common type guards include \`typeof\` checks (e.g., \`typeof x === 'string'\`), \`instanceof\` checks, and equality checks (e.g., \`x === 'literal'\`).
- For union types of string or number literals, direct equality checks (\`===\`) are very effective type guards.
- This allows you to write logic that is specific to each possible type within the union, with full type safety.`,
      quickRules: `**Quick rules:**
- ✅ Use \`if\` statements with equality checks (\`===\`) for narrowing string or number literal union types.
- ✅ Employ \`typeof\` checks (e.g., \`typeof value === 'string'\`) for unions of primitive types.
- ✅ Utilize \`instanceof\` checks (e.g., \`value instanceof MyClass\`) for unions involving class instances.
- ✅ Consider a \`switch\` statement for exhaustive checks on string or number literal unions.
- ❌ Do not rely on runtime behavior without explicit type guards; TypeScript won't infer types magically.
- ❌ Avoid using \`any\` to bypass type narrowing; it defeats the purpose of type safety.
- ❌ Do not forget to handle all possible cases in a union, especially when dealing with complex object unions.`,
      watchOut: `👀 **Watch out:** When using \`if/else if\` for exhaustive checks on a union type, it's good practice to include a final \`else\` block (or a \`default\` case in a \`switch\`) that handles any unhandled cases. For example, you can use a helper function like \`const assertNever = (x: never): never => { throw new Error("Unexpected object: " + x); };\` and call it in the \`else\` block. If you later add a new member to your union type and forget to update your \`if/else if\` chain, TypeScript will give an error in the \`assertNever\` call, reminding you to handle the new case.`,
      dryRun: `🔁 **Think:** Given \`type Fruit = 'apple' | 'banana'; function describeFruit(fruit: Fruit) { if (fruit === 'apple') { console.log('Red and round.'); } else { console.log('Yellow and curved.'); } }\`.
1.  \`describeFruit('apple');\` -> \`fruit\` is 'apple'. The \`if\` condition \`fruit === 'apple'\` is true. Logs "Red and round."
2.  \`describeFruit('banana');\` -> \`fruit\` is 'banana'. The \`if\` condition \`fruit === 'apple'\` is false. The \`else\` block executes. Logs "Yellow and curved."
(Hint: The conditional check narrows the type within its block.)`,

Think of a union type as a specialized dictionary that lists all the *only* valid words for a particular concept (like item status).

\`\`\`
- A single \`type\` alias for a union type acts as a centralized definition for all possible states.
- When you add a new state to the union type, TypeScript immediately highlights all places where this type is used but not fully handled (e.g., in \`if/else if\` chains or \`switch\` statements).
- This "compile-time feedback" guides you through necessary updates, drastically reducing the chance of missing a case.
- It makes your code self-documenting, clearly showing all allowed values at a glance.`,

- ✅ Define all discrete states for a concept using a single union type alias.
- ✅ Leverage TypeScript's compiler errors to guide you when adding new states to a union.
- ✅ Use union types to clearly document the expected values for properties and parameters.
- ✅ Prefer union types over loose \`string\` types for finite sets of values to enhance maintainability.
- ❌ Do not hardcode string literals for states in multiple places; use a union type.
- ❌ Avoid \`any\` as a workaround for unhandled union members; address the missing logic instead.
- ❌ Do not create separate, disconnected type definitions for the same set of states.`,

However, if you forget to actually *implement* the logic for the new status (e.g., adding the \`else if (item.status === 'archived')\` block), your code will still compile but might behave unexpectedly for the new status at runtime. Always ensure your runtime logic matches your type definitions.`,

2.  The error indicates that 'pending' is not handled.
3.  You would then add \`else if (s === 'closed') { /* ... */ } else if (s === 'pending') { /* ... */ }\` to resolve the error and correctly handle the new state.
