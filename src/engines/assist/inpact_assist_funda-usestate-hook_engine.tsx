      title: "Managing UI State with useState",
      body: `Modern web applications are highly interactive, constantly responding to user input and changing data. To achieve this dynamism, components need a way to "remember" information that can change over time and affect what's displayed on the screen. This internal memory, or "state," is crucial for building user interfaces that feel alive and responsive. Without a mechanism to manage state, a component would simply render once with static data, unable to update its appearance or behavior based on user actions like clicks, form submissions, or data fetching. The \`useState\` hook provides the fundamental building block for giving functional components this essential memory.

This pattern is ubiquitous across all interactive UI development. You'll use \`useState\` to manage the visibility of elements (like a dropdown menu or a modal dialog), track the input values in a form field, control the active tab in a navigation bar, or keep track of whether a button is enabled or disabled. Any piece of data that can change and needs to trigger a re-render of your component is a candidate for \`useState\`. Mastering this hook is a prerequisite for building any non-trivial interactive user interface.`,

You can look at the contents (read \`isVisible\`), but you can't just walk in and change them directly. \`setIsVisible\` is the only authorized gatekeeper.

\`\`\`
-   **Immutability:** In React, state should be treated as immutable. Instead of modifying the existing state object/value, you always create a *new* one and pass it to the setter function.
-   **Re-rendering:** Calling the setter function (\`setIsVisible\`) is React's signal to know that the component's state has changed and that it needs to re-render the component with the new state value.
-   **Batching:** React often batches multiple state updates for performance. The setter function integrates with this internal optimization.`,

-   ✅ Always use the setter function returned by \`useState\` to update state.
-   ✅ Treat state variables as immutable; pass new values to the setter.
-   ✅ Use the functional update form (\`setCount(prev => prev + 1)\`) when the new state depends on the previous state.
-   ✅ Understand that calling a setter triggers a re-render of the component.
-   ❌ Never directly modify the state variable (e.g., \`myArray.push(item)\` or \`myObject.property = value\`).

-   ❌ Avoid complex logic or side effects directly within the setter call.`,
