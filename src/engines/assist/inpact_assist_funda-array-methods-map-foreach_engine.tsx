      body: `Software applications frequently deal with collections of data, such as lists of users, products, or configuration settings. Efficiently processing, transforming, or displaying each item in these collections is a fundamental task. Without specialized tools, iterating over these arrays can become repetitive and prone to errors, especially when you need to create new data structures or render dynamic user interfaces based on the original data. Array methods like \`map()\` and \`forEach()\` provide concise, readable, and powerful ways to handle these common scenarios, abstracting away the boilerplate of traditional loop constructs.

This pattern is ubiquitous across almost all software engineering domains. You'll encounter it when populating a dropdown menu with options fetched from a server, rendering a list of tasks in a project management tool, generating a summary report from a dataset, or applying a consistent transformation to a batch of user inputs. Understanding these methods is a critical prerequisite for building dynamic and data-driven applications, as they form the backbone of how data is manipulated and presented in modern programming.`,

- Each element in the array is an object literal \`{}\` conforming to the \`MyItem\` interface.
- Explicitly typing the array (e.g., \`MyItem[]\`) provides strong type checking and better developer experience.`,

- ✅ Use an \`interface\` to define the consistent shape of objects within a collection.

For the first object \`{ id: 'a1', name: 'Alpha', value: 10, isActive: true }\`, it confirms all properties are present and their types match the interface. It does the same for the second and third objects. If any property were missing or had a wrong type (e.g., \`value: 'ten'\`), TypeScript would flag an error.

      hook: `Imagine you're building a dashboard that displays a list of recent notifications. Each notification comes from your backend as an object with properties like \`id\`, \`message\`, \`timestamp\`, and \`type\`. You need to render these as a series of visual cards on the screen. Manually creating a card for each notification would be tedious and error-prone, especially if the list changes dynamically. How do you efficiently translate an array of data objects into an array of visual elements that your UI framework can render? This is a core challenge in front-end development.`,
      pain: `⚠️ **Lesson:** Manually creating and managing individual UI elements for each item in a data array is inefficient, unscalable, and leads to repetitive code. Symptom: You find yourself writing similar blocks of code for each item you want to display, or struggling to update the UI when the underlying data changes.`,
      mentalModel: `**Mental model:** The UI Renderer. Think of \`map\` as a specialized printing press for your user interface. You feed it a stack of data blueprints (your array of data objects). For each blueprint, the press applies a template (your callback function) to generate a finished, displayable page (a string or UI component). The output is a new stack of these finished pages, ready to be presented to the user. The original blueprints remain intact.`,

interface Product {

  name: string;

const products: Product[] = [
  { id: 'p1', name: 'Laptop', price: 1200 },

\`\`\`
- \`map\` is commonly used to iterate over data arrays and generate an array of strings or UI components.
- Each element in the original data array corresponds to one generated display element.
- Template literals (\`\`\`) are excellent for constructing formatted strings from object properties.
- In UI frameworks, the result of \`map\` (an array of components) can often be directly rendered.`,
      quickRules: `**Quick rules:**
- ✅ Use \`map\` to generate a list of strings or UI elements from an array of data.
- ✅ Ensure each item in the original array results in one displayable element.
- ✅ Use template literals (\`\`\`) for clear and concise string formatting.
- ✅ Remember that \`map\` returns a new array, which is then used for rendering.
- ❌ Do not try to manually create individual display elements for each data item.
- ❌ Do not use \`forEach\` if you need to generate a new array of displayable elements.
- ❌ Do not forget to return a value (the display element) from the \`map\` callback.`,
      watchOut: `👀 **Watch out:** When using \`map\` to render lists in UI frameworks (like React), you often need to provide a unique \`key\` prop to each rendered item. While not directly part of the \`map\` method itself, it's a critical consideration for performance and correct rendering of dynamic lists. Forgetting keys can lead to unexpected behavior or performance issues in complex UIs.`,
      dryRun: `🔁 **Think:** When \`items.map()\` is called in this step, the callback function constructs a formatted string for each item.
1. For the first item \`{ id: 'a1', name: 'Alpha', value: 10, isActive: true }\`, \`item.name\` is 'Alpha' and \`item.isActive\` is \`true\`. The \`status\` variable becomes 'Active'. The callback returns "Item: Alpha (Status: Active)".
2. For the second item \`{ id: 'b2', name: 'Beta', value: 20, isActive: false }\`, \`item.name\` is 'Beta' and \`item.isActive\` is \`false\`. The \`status\` variable becomes 'Inactive'. The callback returns "Item: Beta (Status: Inactive)".
3. The \`displayItems\` array will then be \`["Item: Alpha (Status: Active)", "Item: Beta (Status: Inactive)", "Item: Gamma (Status: Active)"]\`. (Hint: The conditional logic within the callback determines part of the output string.)`,
