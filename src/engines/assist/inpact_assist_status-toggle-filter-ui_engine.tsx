    deepDiveLabel: "Why is immutable state updating crucial in React?",
    deepDive: {
      hook: `
        Imagine you have a list of items displayed on your screen. A user interacts with one item, changing its status. If you directly modify the original array of items in your component's state, React won't necessarily detect that a change has occurred. It might compare the "old" array reference with the "new" array reference, find they are the same (because you mutated the original object), and decide not to re-render the component. This leads to a stale UI where the user's action appears to have no effect, causing confusion and a broken user experience. This problem is particularly insidious because it doesn't always throw an error; the UI just fails to update.
      `,
      pain: `
        ⚠️ **Lesson:** Stale UI due to direct state mutation. Symptom: User actions don't reflect visually in the UI, or unexpected behavior occurs because React's rendering optimizations are bypassed.
      `,
      mentalModel: `
        **Mental model:** The "New Edition Principle." Think of your component's state as a book. When you want to make a change, you don't scribble directly into the existing book (mutating state). Instead, you create a brand new edition of the book (a new state object or array) that incorporates your changes. You then tell React, "Here's the new edition!" React can then easily compare the old edition with the new one, quickly identify what has changed, and efficiently update only the necessary parts of the UI. If you just scribble in the old book, React might not realize anything is different, and the readers (users) will see the old content.
      `,
      discover: `
        **Pattern - Immutable Array Updates:**
        \`\`\`tsx
        // Original state
        const [items, setItems] = useState([{ id: 1, name: 'A' }, { id: 2, name: 'B' }]);

        // ❌ Direct mutation (bad)
        // items[0].name = 'New A';
        // setItems(items); // React might not re-render!

        // ✅ Immutable update (good) - updating an item
        const updatedItems = items.map(item =>
          item.id === 1 ? { ...item, name: 'New A' } : item
        );
        setItems(updatedItems); // React sees a new array reference and re-renders

        // ✅ Immutable update (good) - adding an item
        setItems(prevItems => [...prevItems, { id: 3, name: 'C' }]);

        // ✅ Immutable update (good) - removing an item
        setItems(prevItems => prevItems.filter(item => item.id !== 2));
        \`\`\`
        - When updating arrays or objects in state, always create a *new* array or object.
        - Use array methods like \`map\`, \`filter\`, \`slice\`, or the spread syntax (\`...\`) to create new copies.
        - For objects, use the object spread syntax (\`{ ...oldObject, newProp: value }\`) to create a new object with updated properties.
        - This allows React to detect changes by comparing references and optimize re-renders.
      `,
      quickRules: `
        **Quick rules:**
        - ✅ Always create new array or object references when updating state.
        - ✅ Use \`map\` for transforming array elements.
        - ✅ Use \`filter\` for removing array elements.
        - ✅ Use spread syntax (\`...\`) for adding elements or merging objects.
        - ❌ Never directly modify state objects or arrays.
        - ❌ Don't use methods like \`push\`, \`pop\`, \`splice\`, or direct assignment on state arrays.
        - ❌ Avoid reassigning properties of state objects directly.
      `,
      watchOut: `
        👀 **Watch out:** Deeply nested objects or arrays can be tricky. If you have an array of objects, and those objects themselves contain arrays, you might need to perform multiple levels of immutable updates. Libraries like Immer can simplify this process by allowing you to write "mutating" logic that internally produces immutable updates, making your code cleaner for complex state structures.
      `,
      dryRun: `
        🔁 **Think:** Initial \`items\` state: \`[{ id: 1, status: 'active' }]\`. When \`toggleItemStatus(1, 'active')\` is called, it calculates \`newStatus\` as \`'archived'\`. Then, \`setItems\` is called with a function: \`prevItems => prevItems.map(...)\`. The \`map\` function creates a *new array*. Inside \`map\`, for item with \`id: 1\`, it creates a *new object* \`{ ...item, status: 'archived' }\`. The final \`setItems\` receives \`[{ id: 1, status: 'archived' }]\`. React compares the *reference* of the old array with the *reference* of the new array. Since they are different, React knows the state has changed and triggers a re-render. (Hint: The key is creating new references for arrays and objects.)

      hook: `
        It's a common pitfall for beginners: you've written a perfect event handler function, but when you try to attach it to a button or input, it either fires immediately when the component renders, or it doesn't fire at all when the user interacts with the element. This can lead to unexpected behavior, infinite loops, or simply a non-responsive UI. Imagine a button that's supposed to increment a counter, but instead, it increments it a thousand times as soon as the page loads, or a filter dropdown that never actually filters anything. The subtle difference in how you pass your event handler can make or break your component's interactivity.
      `,
      pain: `
        ⚠️ **Lesson:** Incorrect event handler binding. Symptom: Event handlers fire prematurely (on render) or not at all (on interaction), leading to broken interactivity, infinite loops, or unexpected side effects.
      `,
      mentalModel: `
        **Mental model:** The "Function Reference vs. Function Call." Think of an event handler like a doorbell. When you attach \`onClick={handler}\`, you're essentially telling the doorbell, "Here's the *name* of the person (the function) to call when someone presses me." The doorbell then waits for a press before making the call. When you attach \`onClick={handler()}\`, you're immediately *calling* the person (executing the function) *right now* and then giving the doorbell whatever that person *returns*. If the function returns nothing (like \`void\`), the doorbell has nothing to call later. If it returns a new function, that new function becomes the handler. The key is to provide the doorbell with a *reference* to the function, not the *result* of calling it immediately.

        \`\`\`tsx

          const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

          // Handler function
          const increment = () => {
            setCount(prev => prev + 1);
          };

          // Handler function that needs arguments
          const incrementBy = (amount: number) => {
            setCount(prev => prev + amount);
          };

          return (
            <div>
              <p>Count: {count}</p>
              {/* ✅ Correct: Pass a reference to the function */}
              <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>

              {/* ✅ Correct: Use an arrow function to call with arguments */}
              <button onClick={() => incrementBy(5)}>Increment by 5</button>

        \`\`\`
        - When an event handler doesn't need arguments, pass a direct reference to the function: \`onClick={myFunction}\`.
        - When an event handler needs arguments, wrap the function call in an anonymous arrow function: \`onClick={() => myFunction(arg1, arg2)}\`. This ensures the function is called only when the event occurs.
        - Passing \`myFunction()\` directly executes the function during the render phase, and its return value (often \`undefined\`) is then assigned as the event handler, which is usually not the desired behavior.
        - Event handlers in JSX are camelCased (e.g., \`onClick\`, \`onChange\`), not lowercase HTML attributes (e.g., \`onclick\`).
      `,
      quickRules: `
        **Quick rules:**
        - ✅ Pass a function reference for handlers without arguments: \`onClick={myHandler}\`.
        - ✅ Use an arrow function wrapper for handlers with arguments: \`onClick={() => myHandler(arg)}\`.
        - ✅ Ensure your handler functions are defined within the component or passed as props.
        - ✅ Use camelCase for event handler props (e.g., \`onChange\`, \`onInput\`).
        - ❌ Never call the handler function directly in JSX if it's meant to run on an event: \`onClick={myHandler()}\`.
        - ❌ Don't use lowercase HTML event attributes (e.g., \`onclick\`) in JSX.
        - ❌ Avoid complex logic directly inside the JSX event handler; extract it to a named function.
      `,
      watchOut: `
        👀 **Watch out:** When using an arrow function wrapper like \`onClick={() => myFunction(arg)}\` inside a list's \`map\` method, a new function is created on every render for each list item. For very large lists or performance-critical scenarios, this *can* sometimes be a minor optimization concern, though typically negligible. If it becomes an issue, you might consider memoizing the child component or lifting the handler definition. However, for most cases, the arrow function wrapper is perfectly acceptable and readable.
      `,
      dryRun: `
        🔁 **Think:** When the \`ItemManager\` component first renders, the \`select\` element's \`onChange\` prop is assigned the *reference* to the \`handleFilterChange\` function. The button's \`onClick\` prop is assigned a *new arrow function* \`() => toggleItemStatus(item.id, item.status)\` for each item. Neither \`handleFilterChange\` nor \`toggleItemStatus\` are executed at this point. When a user clicks a button, the associated arrow function executes, which then calls \`toggleItemStatus\` with the correct arguments. If we had written \`onClick={toggleItemStatus(item.id, item.status)}\`, \`toggleItemStatus\` would execute immediately during render, causing an infinite loop or an error. (Hint: The arrow function delays execution until the event occurs.)
