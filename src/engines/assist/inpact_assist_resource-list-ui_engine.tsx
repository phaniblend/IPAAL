        Imagine you're building a complex machine, but you don't have a blueprint or a clear list of parts. You'd constantly be guessing which piece fits where, what it's supposed to do, and how it interacts with other parts. This is similar to writing JavaScript without types or understanding fundamental hooks. You might get something working, but it's fragile, hard to debug, and a nightmare to extend or collaborate on. Without a clear structure for your data (types) and predictable ways to manage dynamic behavior (hooks), your application becomes a tangled mess of assumptions and potential runtime errors. You'll spend more time fixing unexpected bugs than building new features, and every change feels like walking through a minefield.

        ⚠️ **Lesson:** Without explicit type definitions, JavaScript code can be prone to runtime errors due to unexpected data shapes, making refactoring and collaboration difficult. Similarly, without understanding core hooks like \`useState\` and \`useEffect\`, managing component lifecycle and reactive data becomes convoluted, leading to inefficient updates and unpredictable UI behavior. Symptom: Frequent \`undefined is not a function\` or \`cannot read property 'x' of undefined\` errors, components that don't update correctly, or side effects that run too often or not at all.

Think of types as the blueprint for your data – they define the exact shape and properties of every piece of information your component handles, preventing miscommunications. Hooks, on the other hand, are the component's life support system. \`useState\` provides the component's memory, allowing it to remember things that change over time (like user input or fetched data). \`useEffect\` gives the component the ability to perform actions that interact with the outside world (like fetching data from an API or setting up event listeners) and clean up after itself, ensuring it behaves correctly throughout its existence.

        👀 **Watch out:** While \`useState\` and \`useEffect\` are powerful, misusing them can lead to problems. Forgetting to include dependencies in \`useEffect\` can cause stale closures or infinite loops. Over-using \`useState\` for every small piece of data can make components harder to reason about. Always consider if a piece of data truly needs to be state, or if it can be derived from props or other state.

        -   **\`async/await\`**: Used for handling asynchronous operations (like \`fetch\`) in a more readable, synchronous-looking way.
        -   **\`setLoading(true/false)\`**: Manages the loading state, providing visual feedback to the user.
        -   **\`setError(message)\`**: Captures and displays any errors that occur during the fetch operation.
        -   **Dependency Array (\`[filterStatus]\`)**: Crucial for controlling when the effect re-runs. If \`filterStatus\` changes, the effect runs again. An empty array (\`[]\`) means it runs once on mount. Omitting it means it runs on every render (often an infinite loop).

        **Quick rules:**
        - ✅ Use \`useEffect\` for all side effects (data fetching, subscriptions, manual DOM changes).
        - ✅ Always include all values from the component scope that the effect depends on in the dependency array.
        - ✅ Handle loading and error states within your data fetching logic.
        - ✅ Define \`async\` functions inside \`useEffect\` and call them immediately.
        - ❌ Don't fetch data directly in the component body (outside \`useEffect\`).

        👀 **Watch out:** Common pitfalls include forgetting to include all dependencies in the \`useEffect\` array, leading to stale closures where the effect uses an outdated value of a variable. Another is not handling cleanup for subscriptions or timers, which can cause memory leaks. For data fetching, ensure you have a mechanism to cancel ongoing requests if the component unmounts or the dependencies change before the fetch completes, though this is an advanced topic for beginners.

        Imagine a light switch that doesn't actually turn on or off the light. You flip it, but nothing happens. This is what happens in a UI when you have interactive elements (buttons, inputs, dropdowns) but no event handlers to respond to user actions. The user clicks, types, or selects, but the application remains unresponsive, leading to a frustrating and broken experience. Without event handlers, your UI is just a static display, unable to react to the very interactions it's designed for.

      pain: `
        ⚠️ **Lesson:** Without proper event handlers, user interactions with UI elements (like clicks, input changes, or selections) will not trigger any state updates or corresponding changes in the application's logic or display. Symptom: Unresponsive UI elements, data not being captured from forms, or interactive components failing to perform their intended actions.
      `,
      mentalModel: `
        **Mental model:** The UI's Listener and Messenger. Think of an event handler as a dedicated listener attached to a specific UI element (like our filter dropdown). When a user interacts with that element (e.g., selects an option), the listener "hears" the event. The handler then acts as a messenger, taking information from the event (like the new selected value) and delivering it to the component's state management system (e.g., calling \`setFilterStatus\`). This message then triggers a re-render, updating the UI to reflect the user's action and potentially initiating other processes like data fetching.

        -   **\`const handleFilterChange = (e: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLSelectElement>) => { ... }\`**: Defines an arrow function that takes an event object \`e\`. \`React.ChangeEvent<HTMLSelectElement>\` provides strong typing for the event from a \`select\` element.

      hook: `
        Imagine a website where you always see "Loading..." even after the data arrives, or an error message that never disappears, or an empty list that just shows a blank screen without telling you why. This creates a confusing and broken user experience. Without conditional rendering, your UI can't adapt to different states of your application (loading, error, empty, data available). Without list mapping, you'd have to manually write out each item, making dynamic lists impossible and leading to repetitive, unmaintainable code.
      `,
      pain: `
        ⚠️ **Lesson:** Failing to implement conditional rendering leads to static, unresponsive UIs that don't provide feedback for loading, errors, or empty states. Not using list mapping results in repetitive, unscalable code for displaying dynamic collections of data. Symptom: Poor user experience, redundant JSX, difficulty in updating or sorting lists, and a lack of clear communication about the application's current status.
      `,
      mentalModel: `
        **Mental model:** The UI's Dynamic Director and Assembly Line. Conditional rendering is like a director on a movie set, deciding which scene (loading spinner, error message, empty state, or the actual list) should be shown based on the current script (your component's state). It ensures only the relevant UI is visible. List mapping, on the other hand, is like an efficient assembly line. You provide a blueprint for a single item (e.g., a resource card), and the \`map\` function automatically replicates that blueprint for every piece of data in your collection, assembling a full list without manual repetition.
      `,
      discover: `
        **Pattern - Conditional Rendering and List Mapping:**
        \`\`\`tsx
        // Conditional Rendering
        {loading && <p>Loading data...</p>}
        {error && <p style={{ color: 'red' }}>Error: {error}</p>}
        {!loading && !error && items.length === 0 && <p>No items found.</p>}

        // List Mapping

          <ul>
            {items.map(item => (
              <li key={item.id}>
                {/* Render item details */}
                <strong>{item.title}</strong> - {item.status}

          </ul>
        )}
        \`\`\`
        -   **\`value={filterStatus}\`**: Makes the \`<select>\` a controlled component. Its displayed value is always synchronized with the \`filterStatus\` state.
        -   **\`onChange={handleFilterChange}\`**: Attaches our event handler to the \`<select>\` element, so \`handleFilterChange\` runs whenever the user changes the selection.
        -   **\`{condition && <JSX />}\`**: A common pattern for conditional rendering. If \`condition\` is true, the JSX is rendered; otherwise, nothing is rendered.
        -   **\`{items.map(item => <li key={item.id}>...</li>)}\`**: The \`map\` array method transforms each item in the \`items\` array into a JSX element.
        -   **\`key={item.id}\`**: The \`key\` prop is crucial for lists. It helps the rendering engine efficiently identify which items have changed, been added, or removed, improving performance and preventing bugs. It must be a stable, unique identifier for each item.
      `,
      quickRules: `
        **Quick rules:**
        - ✅ Use \`value\` and \`onChange\` props to make form elements (like \`select\`) controlled components.
        - ✅ Use \`&&\` for simple conditional rendering (show if true).
        - ✅ Use \`map()\` to render lists of items from an array.
        - ✅ Always provide a unique and stable \`key\` prop for each item rendered in a list.
        - ❌ Don't render multiple top-level elements without wrapping them in a fragment (\`<>...</>\`) or a single \`div\`.
        - ❌ Avoid using array index as \`key\` if the list items can change order, be added, or removed.
        - ❌ Never forget to handle all possible UI states (loading, error, empty, data).
      `,
      watchOut: `
        👀 **Watch out:** Incorrect \`key\` props can lead to subtle bugs, especially with input fields or animations in lists. If keys are not stable, the rendering engine might reuse components incorrectly. Also, ensure your conditional rendering logic covers all mutually exclusive states. For example, if \`loading\` is true, you typically don't want to show the empty state or the actual list. Order matters in conditional rendering.
      `,
      dryRun: `
        🔁 **Think:**
        1.  Initial render: \`loading\` is \`true\`. The condition \`loading && <p>Loading...</p>\` evaluates to \`true && <p>Loading...</p>\`, so "Loading..." is displayed. Other conditions are false.
        2.  Fetch completes successfully: \`loading\` becomes \`false\`, \`error\` is \`null\`, \`resources\` has 3 items.
        3.  Component re-renders:
            *   \`loading && ...\` is \`false && ...\`, so nothing.
            *   \`error && ...\` is \`null && ...\`, so nothing.
            *   \`!loading && !error && resources.length === 0 && ...\` is \`true && true && false && ...\`, so nothing.
            *   \`!loading && !error && resources.length > 0 && ...\` is \`true && true && true && ...\`, so the \`map\` function runs, rendering 3 \`<li>\` elements.
        (Hint: JSX conditions are evaluated sequentially, and the first true condition often dictates what is rendered.)
