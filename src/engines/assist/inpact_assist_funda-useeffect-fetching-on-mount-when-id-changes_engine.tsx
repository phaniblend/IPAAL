      body: `When building interactive applications, you often need to load data from a server as soon as a component appears on the screen, or whenever a specific piece of information, like an item's ID, changes. This initial data fetching is crucial for displaying relevant content to the user, whether it's a list of items, details of a selected item, or configuration settings. Without a mechanism to trigger these data requests at the right time, your components would render empty or outdated information, leading to a poor user experience. The challenge lies in performing these "side effects" – operations that interact with the outside world, like network requests – without causing infinite loops or unnecessary re-renders.

      This pattern is fundamental across almost all modern web applications. You'll encounter it when building a user profile page that loads the user's details, a product detail page that fetches information for a specific product ID, or a dashboard that displays analytics based on a selected time range. Any time a component needs to synchronize its internal state with external data, especially when that data depends on props or other state variables, understanding how to manage these effects is essential. Mastering this technique allows you to create dynamic, data-driven UIs that respond intelligently to user interactions and application state changes.`,

- ✅ Initialize state with a sensible default value that matches its expected type.
- ❌ Never declare state variables inside loops, conditionals, or nested functions; hooks must be called at the top level of your functional component.
- ❌ Do not use regular JavaScript variables if their changes need to be reflected in the UI.
- ❌ Avoid complex logic directly within the \`useState\` initial value; if it's expensive, use a function for lazy initialization.`,
      watchOut: `👀 **Watch out:** When updating state based on the *previous* state (e.g., incrementing a counter), always use the functional update form: \`setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1)\`.

      dryRun: `🔁 **Think:** When \`ItemDetailFetcher\` first renders, \`item\` is \`null\`, \`loading\` is \`true\`, and \`error\` is \`null\`.

This causes the component to re-render, and now \`loading\` is \`false\` and \`item\` holds the fetched data, which the UI can then display. (Hint: State changes drive UI updates.)`,

- **Logical AND (\`&&\`):** For simple inline conditions, \`{condition && <JSX />}\` can render JSX only if the condition is true.
- **Ternary Operator (\`?\`):** For choosing between two different JSX outputs, \`{condition ? <JSX1 /> : <JSX2 />}\` is concise.

- ✅ Use early \`return\` statements for critical states like \`loading\` or \`error\` to simplify logic.

- ✅ Ensure that the UI gracefully handles the absence of data (e.g., \`item === null\` or \`item === undefined\`).
- ❌ Avoid deeply nested ternary operators, which can become hard to read.
- ❌ Do not try to render \`item.name\` if \`item\` could be \`null\` or \`undefined\` without a check.
- ❌ Never leave the user without feedback during long-running operations.`,

The \`await\` pauses execution for 1 second. If \`itemId\` is 'w-001', \`setItem\` updates the item. Finally, \`setLoading(false)\` runs, hiding the loading message and displaying the fetched item. If an error occurred during the \`await\`, the \`catch\` block would run, setting an error message before \`finally\` sets \`loading\` to \`false\`. (Hint: The state updates control the UI flow.)`,

    deepDiveLabel: "How does the `useEffect` dependency array prevent infinite loops?",
    deepDive: {
      hook: `Imagine you have a component that fetches data, and after fetching, it updates a piece of state. If you put that state update directly into the \`useEffect\` without a dependency array, or with an incorrect one, what happens? The state update causes a re-render. The re-render causes the \`useEffect\` to run again. The \`useEffect\` fetches data and updates state again. This creates a vicious cycle – an infinite loop of fetching and re-rendering, quickly crashing your application or exhausting your API limits. You need a precise way to tell React: "Only run this effect when *these specific values* have actually changed, not just any time the component re-renders."`,
      pain: `⚠️ **Lesson:** Incorrectly managed \`useEffect\` dependencies lead to infinite loops and performance issues. Symptom: Browser freezing, excessive network requests, and application crashes due to uncontrolled re-renders.`,
      mentalModel: `**Mental model:** The "Change Detector." The dependency array in \`useEffect\` is like a highly specialized change detector. It constantly monitors the values listed within it. The effect function (the first argument to \`useEffect\`) will *only* re-run if one or more of those monitored values have changed since the *last* render. If the array is empty, it means "don't monitor anything, just run once on mount." If it's omitted entirely, it means "monitor everything, run on every render." This precise control prevents unnecessary re-executions.`,
      discover: `**Pattern - \`useEffect\` with Dependencies:**
\`\`\`tsx
useEffect(() => {
  fetchItemDetail();
}, [itemId]); // Dependency array
\`\`\`
- **Effect Function:** The first argument is a function containing the side effect logic (e.g., calling \`fetchItemDetail()\`).
- **Dependency Array:** The second argument is an array of values. The effect will re-run only if any of these values change between renders.
- **Empty Array (\`[]\`):** The effect runs once after the initial render and cleans up on unmount. Useful for \`componentDidMount\` behavior.
- **No Array:** The effect runs after *every* render. This is rarely what you want for data fetching.
- **Including Props/State:** If your effect uses props (like \`itemId\`) or state variables, they should generally be included in the dependency array.`,
      quickRules: `**Quick rules:**
- ✅ Include all values from the component's scope (props, state, functions) that are used inside your \`useEffect\` callback in the dependency array.
- ✅ Use an empty dependency array \`[]\` for effects that should only run once on component mount (e.g., initial data fetch that doesn't depend on props).
- ✅ If your effect returns a cleanup function, ensure it correctly reverses the side effect (e.g., clearing timers, unsubscribing).
- ❌ Never omit the dependency array for data fetching effects, as this will cause an infinite loop of fetching.
- ❌ Do not include values in the dependency array that don't change or are not used by the effect, as this can cause unnecessary re-runs.
- ❌ Avoid putting objects or functions directly into the dependency array if they are re-created on every render, as this will cause the effect to re-run unnecessarily. Use \`useCallback\` or \`useMemo\` if needed.`,
      watchOut: `👀 **Watch out:** If you use a function (like \`fetchItemDetail\` in this example) inside \`useEffect\`, and that function is defined *inside* the component, it will be re-created on every render. If you put it directly into the dependency array, it will cause the effect to re-run on every render, defeating the purpose. To fix this, either move the function outside the component, or wrap it in \`useCallback\` (and include its own dependencies in \`useCallback\`'s array). For simple cases like this module, where \`fetchItemDetail\` only depends on \`itemId\` (which is already in \`useEffect\`'s array), React's ESLint plugin often handles this warning gracefully, but it's a crucial concept for more complex effects.`,
      dryRun: `🔁 **Think:**
1. Component mounts with \`itemId="alpha"\`. \`useEffect\` runs, calling \`fetchItemDetail()\`.
2. \`fetchItemDetail\` sets \`loading=true\`, fetches data for "alpha", then sets \`loading=false\` and \`item={...alpha data}\`.
3. Parent component re-renders \`ItemDetailFetcher\` with \`itemId="beta"\`.
4. React compares \`itemId\` from the previous render (\`"alpha"\`) with the current render (\`"beta"\`). They are different.
5. \`useEffect\` detects the change in \`itemId\` and re-runs, calling \`fetchItemDetail()\` again.
6. \`fetchItemDetail\` sets \`loading=true\`, fetches data for "beta", then sets \`loading=false\` and \`item={...beta data}\`.
(Hint: The dependency array is the gatekeeper for effect re-execution.)`,
