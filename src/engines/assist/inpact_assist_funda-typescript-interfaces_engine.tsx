      title: "Define Data Shapes with TypeScript Interfaces",
      body: `When building software, you often deal with structured data: a user object with a name and email, a product with a price and description, or a configuration setting with a key and value. Without a clear definition of what these objects should look like, it's easy for properties to be misspelled, omitted, or given the wrong type, leading to bugs that are hard to catch until runtime. TypeScript interfaces provide a powerful way to formally declare the expected shape of these objects, allowing the TypeScript compiler to catch these errors *before* your code even runs, saving significant debugging time and improving code reliability.

This pattern is fundamental to nearly all TypeScript development. You'll encounter interfaces when defining the structure of data coming from an API, the properties (props) that a UI component expects, the shape of state managed within an application, or even the contract for objects passed between different parts of your codebase. Understanding how to define and use interfaces is a prerequisite for effectively working with typed data in any JavaScript or TypeScript project, from simple form inputs and settings panels to complex data models and API integrations.`,

Each of these items shares some common properties, like a 'title' and 'releaseYear', but also has unique ones, like 'author' for books or 'director' for movies. As your application grows, you might find yourself needing to extend these definitions, combine them, or even have different parts of your system contribute to the same definition. If you're just using inline type annotations or simple type aliases, you might run into limitations when trying to merge or extend these types in a clean, declarative way. This is where the specific capabilities of interfaces shine, offering a more robust and flexible approach to defining object shapes, especially in large, collaborative codebases where type definitions might need to evolve or be composed from multiple sources.`,

Symptom: You find yourself copying and pasting type definitions or struggling to combine types from different modules.`,
      mentalModel: `**Mental model:** Interface as a Blueprint. Think of an interface as a detailed architectural blueprint for a building. It specifies exactly what rooms (properties) the building must have, what materials they're made of (types), and how they're connected. Just like a blueprint, an interface doesn't *build* the object itself; it only describes its required structure. Multiple contractors (different parts of your code) can then use this single blueprint to construct many identical buildings (objects), ensuring they all conform to the same design. This blueprint can also be extended (e.g., adding a new wing) or combined with other blueprints (e.g., a residential blueprint combined with a commercial one), providing flexibility for future development.`,
      discover: `**Pattern - Defining a Basic Interface:**
\`\`\`tsx
interface MyObject {
  propertyA: string;
  propertyB: number;
  propertyC: boolean;
}
\`\`\`
-   The \`interface\` keyword declares a new interface.
-   The interface name (e.g., \`MyObject\`) should follow PascalCase convention.
-   Inside the curly braces, list each property name followed by a colon and its type (e.g., \`propertyA: string;\`).
-   Each property definition ends with a semicolon.
-   This interface now acts as a contract: any object declared as \`MyObject\` must have these properties with these exact types.`,
      quickRules: `**Quick rules:**
-   ✅ Use \`interface\` to define the shape of objects.
-   ✅ Name interfaces using PascalCase (e.g., \`UserConfig\`).
-   ✅ Specify a type for every property in the interface.
-   ✅ Interfaces are excellent for defining contracts for classes or function parameters.
-   ❌ Do not use \`interface\` to define primitive types (like \`string\` or \`number\`) directly.
-   ❌ Avoid making all properties optional unless explicitly intended, as it reduces type safety.
-   ❌ Do not include implementation logic (functions, constructors) directly within an interface; interfaces describe *shape*, not *behavior*.`,
      watchOut: `👀 **Watch out:** While \`type\` aliases can also define object shapes, interfaces are generally preferred for object types because they can be 'augmented' (merged) by subsequent declarations in the same scope, and they are more idiomatic for class implementations. If you need to define a union or intersection type, or a primitive alias, \`type\` is the way to go. For object shapes, lean towards \`interface\`.`,
      dryRun: `🔁 **Think:** If you define \`interface Point { x: number; y: number; }\` and then try to create an object \`const p: Point = { x: 10 };\`, what happens? The TypeScript compiler will report an error because the \`y\` property is missing, even though \`x\` is correctly typed. If you then try \`const p2: Point = { x: 10, y: "twenty" };\`, the compiler will flag that \`y\` is expected to be a \`number\`, not a \`string\`. (Hint: The interface acts as a strict blueprint.)`,

In contrast, \`avatarUrl?: string;\` clearly communicates that the property itself *might not exist* on the object at all. This distinction becomes critical when you're working with data from external sources (like APIs) where fields might simply be omitted rather than explicitly set to \`undefined\`, or when you're destructuring objects and want to know if a property will even be present.`,

If it *is* there, it must fit perfectly (i.e., have the correct type). A property that is a union with \`undefined\` (e.g., \`string | undefined\`) is like a puzzle piece that *must* be present, but its content could be blank. The \`?\` syntax is a more direct and semantically clear way to express that a property might simply be absent from the object's structure.`,

\`\`\`
-   The \`?\` modifier after the property name makes the property optional.
-   If a property is optional, it means it *might not be present* on objects conforming to the interface.
-   When accessing an optional property, TypeScript will automatically infer its type as \`T | undefined\`.
-   This is semantically different from \`property: Type | undefined;\`, which means the property *must* exist, but its value can be \`undefined\`.`,
      quickRules: `**Quick rules:**
-   ✅ Use \`propertyName?: Type;\` when the property might not exist on the object at all.
-   ✅ Use \`propertyName: Type | undefined;\` when the property *must* exist, but its value can be explicitly \`undefined\`.
-   ✅ Optional properties simplify object creation, as you don't need to provide a value for them.
-   ✅ Optional properties are common for configuration objects or API responses where fields might be omitted.
-   ❌ Don't use \`?\` if the property is always expected to be present, even if its value could be null or undefined.
-   ❌ Avoid making too many properties optional without good reason, as it can reduce type safety.
-   ❌ Do not confuse optional properties with properties that can be \`null\`; \`null\` is a distinct value that must be explicitly allowed in the type (e.g., \`string | null\`).`,
      watchOut: `👀 **Watch out:** When accessing an optional property, TypeScript's strict null checks will require you to handle the \`undefined\` case.

      dryRun: `🔁 **Think:** Consider \`interface User { name: string; age?: number; }\`. If you create \`const u1: User = { name: "Alice" };\`, this is valid because \`age\` is optional.

If your array of notifications is untyped (e.g., just \`const notifications = [];\`), you could accidentally push an object with a misspelled property like 'massege' or a 'timestamp' that's a string instead of a Date object. When you later try to display these notifications, your UI component might crash because it expects specific properties and types. Typing the array with an interface ensures that every single notification object in that array conforms to the expected structure, making your list reliable and preventing runtime errors during iteration or display.`,

-   The \`InterfaceName[]\` syntax is the most common way to declare an array whose elements conform to \`InterfaceName\`.
-   Alternatively, \`Array<InterfaceName>\` provides the same functionality.
-   TypeScript will enforce that any element added to this array, or any element retrieved from it, matches the \`InterfaceName\` structure.
-   This provides strong type safety for collections of objects.`,

-   ✅ Use \`InterfaceName[]\` or \`Array<InterfaceName>\` for arrays of objects.

-   ✅ Catches errors at compile-time if an incompatible object is added.
-   ❌ Do not use \`any[]\` or \`Array<any>\` as it negates type safety.
