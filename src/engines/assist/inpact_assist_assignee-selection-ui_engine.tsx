      discover: `**Pattern - The Core React Hooks:**
\`\`\`tsx
import { useState, useEffect, useCallback } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  // useState: Manages local, reactive state
  const [data, setData] = useState([]);

  // useEffect: Handles side effects (data fetching, subscriptions, DOM manipulation)

\`\`\`
- \`useState\` provides a way to add state variables to functional components, returning the current state value and a function to update it.
- \`useEffect\` lets you perform side effects in functional components, such as data fetching, subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM. It runs after every render by default, but can be configured to run only when specific dependencies change.
- \`useCallback\` returns a memoized version of the callback function that only changes if one of the dependencies has changed. This is useful for preventing unnecessary re-renders in child components that rely on reference equality.
- Together, these hooks form the backbone of most interactive and performant functional React components.`,
      quickRules: `**Quick rules:**
- ✅ Use \`useState\` for any piece of data that needs to change and trigger a re-render.
- ✅ Use \`useEffect\` for operations that interact with the browser, network, or other external systems.
- ✅ Use \`useCallback\` to memoize event handlers and other functions passed as props to optimized child components.
- ✅ Always include a dependency array with \`useEffect\` and \`useCallback\` to control when they re-run or re-create.
- ❌ Avoid putting heavy computations directly in the render body; use \`useMemo\` or \`useCallback\` if necessary.
- ❌ Don't call hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions; always call them at the top level of your functional component.
- ❌ Never forget the dependency array for \`useEffect\` if you want to control its execution, or you might create infinite loops or stale closures.`,
      watchOut: `👀 **Watch out:** Incorrect dependency arrays for \`useEffect\` and \`useCallback\` are a common source of bugs. An empty array (\`[]\`) means the effect or callback runs/is created only once on mount. Omitting the array means it runs/is created on every render. Forgetting to include a dependency that the effect or callback relies on can lead to "stale closures," where the function uses an outdated value of a variable. Always ensure your dependency arrays are complete and accurate.`,

1. \`useState(0)\` initializes \`count\` to \`0\` and \`setCount\` is available.
2. The component renders, showing "You clicked 0 times".
3. The \`useEffect\` runs for the first time. \`document.title\` becomes "Count: 0".
4. The user clicks the button. \`setCount(count + 1)\` is called. Since \`count\` is \`0\`, \`setCount(1)\` is triggered.
5. The component re-renders because \`count\` changed.
6. The \`useEffect\` runs again because \`count\` (a dependency) changed from \`0\` to \`1\`. \`document.title\` becomes "Count: 1".

The code could become verbose, especially for simple components, and the logic related to a single feature (like data fetching) might be scattered across multiple lifecycle methods (\`componentDidMount\`, \`componentDidUpdate\`, \`componentWillUnmount\`), making it hard to follow and maintain.

The challenge is to give a pure function "memory" without turning it into a class or relying on global variables, which would break React's component model and make debugging a nightmare.`,

When you call \`useState('initialValue')\`, React assigns a slot in that locker for this specific state variable and stores 'initialValue' there. On subsequent renders, when React sees the same \`useState\` call, it doesn't re-initialize; instead, it retrieves the current value from that locker slot. The setter function (\`setSomething\`) is the key to updating the value in the locker, which then tells React to re-render the component with the new value.`,

\`\`\`
- \`useState\` is a hook that lets you add React state to functional components.
- It returns a pair: the current state value and a function that lets you update it.
- The argument passed to \`useState\` is the initial state. This initial state is only used during the *first* render.
- When the setter function (e.g., \`setIsOn\`) is called, React re-renders the component, and the new state value is provided.`,
      quickRules: `**Quick rules:**
- ✅ Call \`useState\` at the top level of your functional component.
- ✅ Use descriptive names for your state variables and their setters (e.g., \`[count, setCount]\`).
- ✅ Pass a function to the setter if the new state depends on the previous state (e.g., \`setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1)\`).
- ✅ Initialize state with a sensible default value (empty array, null, false, etc.).
- ❌ Never call \`useState\` inside loops, conditions, or nested functions.
- ❌ Don't directly mutate state variables; always use the setter function.
- ❌ Avoid complex objects as initial state if simpler primitives suffice.`,
      watchOut: `👀 **Watch out:** When updating state that is an object or array, always create a *new* object or array. Mutating the existing state object directly (e.g., \`myArray.push(item)\` then \`setMyArray(myArray)\`) will not trigger a re-render because React performs a shallow comparison of the state reference. Instead, use spread syntax or array methods that return new arrays (e.g., \`setMyArray(prevArray => [...prevArray, item])\`).`,

If you just render them without a unique identifier, React struggles to efficiently update the UI when items are added, removed, or reordered. When a list changes, React needs to know *which* specific item has changed, rather than re-rendering the entire list from scratch. Without this crucial piece of information, React's reconciliation algorithm can become inefficient, leading to performance issues, incorrect component state (e.g., an input field losing its value), and unexpected visual glitches. This problem becomes particularly noticeable in dynamic lists where user interactions frequently modify the list's content or order.`,

When React renders a list, it uses these identity cards to track each individual item. If an item's identity card (its \`key\`) remains the same, React knows it's the same item, even if its position or other properties change. If an item with a new identity card appears, React knows it's a new item. This allows React to efficiently update only the necessary parts of the DOM, rather than rebuilding the entire list.`,

- Use the \`Array.prototype.map()\` method to transform an array of data into an array of React elements.
- Always provide a unique \`key\` prop for each item rendered in a list. This \`key\` should be a stable, unique identifier for the item (e.g., a database ID).
- The \`key\` prop helps React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed, enabling efficient reconciliation.
- Avoid using array index as a \`key\` if the list items can be reordered, added, or removed, as this can lead to performance issues and incorrect component state.`,
      quickRules: `**Quick rules:**
- ✅ Use \`map\` to render lists of elements from an array.
- ✅ Always provide a unique and stable \`key\` prop for each list item.

- ❌ Never use array index as a \`key\` if the list can change order or size.
- ❌ Don't use non-unique values for keys; they must be unique among siblings.
- ❌ Avoid complex objects or mutable values as keys.`,
      watchOut: `👀 **Watch out:** While using \`index\` as a \`key\` might seem convenient, it's generally an anti-pattern unless your list is static and will never change order, be filtered, or have items added/removed. If the list changes, using \`index\` as a \`key\` can cause React to incorrectly reuse or re-render components, leading to unexpected behavior, performance degradation, and even data corruption in input fields within list items. Always prioritize stable, unique IDs for your keys.`,
      dryRun: `🔁 **Think:** A list of two tasks: \`[{ id: "t1", desc: "Buy milk" }, { id: "t2", desc: "Walk dog" }]\`.
1. The component renders, mapping over the tasks.
2. \`<li>Buy milk</li>\` with \`key="t1"\` is rendered.
3. \`<li>Walk dog</li>\` with \`key="t2"\` is rendered.
4. A new task is added at the beginning: \`[{ id: "t3", desc: "Clean room" }, { id: "t1", desc: "Buy milk" }, { id: "t2", desc: "Walk dog" }]\`.
5. React sees \`key="t3"\` as new, renders a new \`<li>Clean room</li>\`.
6. React sees \`key="t1"\` and \`key="t2"\` still exist, but their positions changed. Because of the stable keys, React efficiently moves the existing DOM elements for "Buy milk" and "Walk dog" rather than re-creating them.

For complex scenarios, consider using a more sophisticated state management solution (like a global store with transaction IDs) or a library specifically designed for optimistic updates (e.g., React Query, SWR).`,
      dryRun: `🔁 **Think:** Task "Task A" (id: "res-1", assigneeId: "user-1") is displayed. User tries to reassign it to "user-2".
1. \`handleAssign("res-1", "user-2")\` is called.
2. \`originalTasks\` captures the current state (Task A assigned to user-1).
3. \`setTasks\` is called: Task A's \`assigneeId\` becomes "user-2" and \`isPending\` becomes \`true\`.
4. UI re-renders: "Task A assigned to User B (pending)".
5. API call starts.
6. **Scenario A: API succeeds.**
    a. API call resolves.
    b. \`setTasks\` is called: Task A's \`isPending\` becomes \`false\`.
    c. UI re-renders: "Task A assigned to User B".
7. **Scenario B: API fails.**
    a. API call rejects.
    b. \`catch\` block executes. \`setError\` is called.
    c. \`setTasks(originalTasks)\` is called: Task A's \`assigneeId\` reverts to "user-1" and \`isPending\` is removed (as it was not in originalTasks).
    d. UI re-renders: "Task A assigned to User A" and an error message is shown.
(Hint: Trace the \`assigneeId\` and \`isPending\` properties of "Task A" through both success and failure paths.)`,

If you let each input manage its own state internally (an "uncontrolled component"), retrieving the form's data when the user clicks "submit" becomes a challenge. You'd have to manually query the DOM for each input's current value. Furthermore, if you want to programmatically set an input's value, validate it in real-time, or disable it based on other form data, it becomes incredibly difficult to synchronize the UI with your application's logic. This can lead to inconsistent data, complex event handling, and a brittle form experience.`,

      mentalModel: `**Mental model:** The "Puppeteer and Puppet." Think of a controlled component as a puppet (the input field) whose every movement (its value) is dictated by a puppeteer (your React state). The puppeteer holds the strings (the \`value\` prop) and listens for the puppet's signals (the \`onChange\` event). When the puppet signals a change, the puppeteer updates its own state, and then, in turn, pulls the strings to update the puppet's display. This ensures that your React state is always the single source of truth for the input's value.`,

    setName(event.target.value); // Update state on every change

- A controlled component is a form input element whose value is controlled by React state.
- The input's \`value\` prop is set by a state variable.
- An \`onChange\` event handler updates that state variable whenever the input's value changes.
- This creates a "single source of truth" for the input's data, making it easy to validate, manipulate, and submit.`,
      quickRules: `**Quick rules:**
- ✅ Always bind an input's \`value\` prop to a piece of React state.
- ✅ Always provide an \`onChange\` handler that updates the bound state.
- ✅ Use controlled components for all form inputs (text, select, checkbox, radio).
- ✅ Initialize controlled components with appropriate default values from state.
- ❌ Never let an input manage its own state if you need to access or modify its value programmatically.
- ❌ Don't forget to provide both \`value\` and \`onChange\` for controlled inputs.
- ❌ Avoid directly manipulating the DOM to get or set input values in React.`,
      watchOut: `👀 **Watch out:** When using a controlled \`select\` element, the \`value\` prop on the \`<select>\` tag determines which \`<option>\` is selected. The \`value\` prop on the \`<option>\` tags should match the values you expect to receive. If your \`select\`'s \`value\` is \`null\` or \`undefined\`, and you don't have an \`<option value="">\` (or similar empty string option), React will treat it as an uncontrolled component and issue a warning. Always ensure your controlled \`select\` has a matching option for its current value, or a default empty option.`,
      dryRun: `🔁 **Think:** A \`NameInput\` component is rendered.
1. \`useState('')\` initializes \`name\` to an empty string.
2. The input renders with an empty value: \`<input value="" />\`.
3. The user types "A" into the input.
4. The \`onChange\` handler is called. \`event.target.value\` is "A".
5. \`setName("A")\` is called.
6. The component re-renders.
7. The input now renders with \`value="A"\`: \`<input value="A" />\`.
8. The user types "B".
9. The \`onChange\` handler is called. \`event.target.value\` is "AB".
10. \`setName("AB")\` is called.
11. The component re-renders.
12. The input now renders with \`value="AB"\`: \`<input value="AB" />\`.
(Hint: Trace how the \`name\` state variable directly dictates the input's displayed value.)`,
